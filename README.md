**Portfolio Projects**
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

**Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization:**

Electric Power Consumption Analysis

Description:
Time-series trends (kWh/capita) across 8 countries (2001–2014); line/bar/pie charts show China's 200% surge vs. Canada's peak.
Tech Stack:Pandas, Matplotlib
Insights:Highlights development gaps (India <1k vs. Canada >16k); relative shares shift (China +7%).

World Bank Energy & Emissions Analysis

Description:
Electricity sources (coal/hydro) and CO2 (kt) for US/China/India/Japan (1960–2022); correlations (r=0.8) and trends.
Tech Stack:Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Insights:China leads CO2 (~10B kt); declining coal in West, rising in Asia—urgent renewables push.

Cereal Yield Global Analysis

Description:
Yields (kg/ha) by top producers (2010–2018); stacked bars/maps link to GDP (r=0.7).
Tech Stack:Pandas, Matplotlib
Insights:US/China top; Europe hotspots—tech/climate drives +20% variance.

Infographics Compilation

Description:
Multi-project visuals (e.g., energy lines, yield maps)
Tech Stack:Matplotlib, ReportLab
Insights:Unified storytelling: Trends > tables; e.g., India's energy growth in one glance.

**Machine Learning & Regression**

Linear vs. Logistic Regression on Adult Dataset

Description:
Linear predicts 'fnlwgt' (MSE~1.2e12); Logistic classifies income (>50K, acc~82%).
Tech Stack:scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Insights:Education/occupation key; Logistic F1=0.75 for minority class—imbalance addressed via encoding.

Energy-Population Clustering & Curve Fitting

Description:
K-Means (k=3) clusters 4 regions (1985–2019); polynomials predict growth (India +3x).
Tech Stack:scikit-learn, SciPy, Seaborn
Insights:r=0.82 energy-pop; EU high-cluster—sustainability focus for India.

Weather Data Database Design

Description:
Synthetic DB (SQLite/Faker); queries avg temp/rain by country (e.g., India 28°C).
Tech Stack:SQLite, Faker, Pandas
Insights:FK integrity; ethics: Synthetic avoids PII—extensible for anomalies.

**Time Series & Forecasting.**

Time Series Modeling & Forecasting

Description:
ARMA/LSTM/GRU on JJ sales (1960–1980) & Amazon stock (2000–2023); LSTM MAPE=3.5%.
Tech Stack:Statsmodels, Keras
Insights:RNNs > ARMA for volatility; Amazon to $250 (2026), JJ +15%.

**Computer Vision & NLP.**

Image Segmentation with COCO-2017

Description:
Mask R-CNN on subset (cake/car/dog/person); IoU=0.70 avg ('person' 0.75).
Tech Stack:TensorFlow/Keras, pycocotools
Insights:Imbalance hurts 'cake' (0.60)—augmentation +10% potential.

Keras Animal Classification

Description:
CNN (Conv2D/GlobalAvgPool) classifies cat/dog/wild (64x64); val acc~85%.
Tech Stack:Keras/TensorFlow, tf.data
Insights:Wild F1=0.75 (variance); LR decay prevents overfit.

Automated Image Captioning

Description:
CNN-LSTM on MS COCO (BLEU-4=0.28); attention +8%.
Tech Stack:TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK
Insights:Strong on scenes; Western bias in data—multilingual future.


**Big Data & Database.**

Netflix Streaming Trends with PySpark

Description:
Spark queries Top 10 data (~7M rows); top films/seasons by weeks (e.g., "Stranger Things" 52 UK weeks).
Tech Stack:PySpark, DataFrames
Insights:Regional prefs: K-dramas Asia; scalable for 50+ countries.
